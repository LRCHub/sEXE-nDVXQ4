[00:09.96] I wanna share your life every minute every day and night
[00:21.69] And I just want you to know that whatever you do and wherever you go
[00:34.27] Remember someone loves you honey no matter what just be my girl
[00:46.89] Someone loves you honey more than anything in the world
[01:00.34] [ Strings ]
[01:08.40] I'm so glad that I'm the one that you come to when you need someone
[01:19.21] That's what my love is for that's a shoulder to lean on a port in the storm
[01:31.09] Remember someone loves you...
